I'm back. Had to move, had to travel, had to redesign this website. This is a directory to all my content. Welcome! Sign the guestbook. As I'm writing this, I'm learning that ESPN is in talks to acquire UFC Fight Pass which is an absolute nightmare to me. I love fightpass, even with its horrible archiving and features that are archaic. Its still better than anything ESPN could do because ESPN's technology is dog's ass. Sad day. Sad news.

A lot has happened. The last event I talked about on here was UFC 314. Nailed it.
