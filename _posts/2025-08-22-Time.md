I'm back! Life's been a whirlwind—moving, traveling, and redesigning this website from the ground up. Welcome to my content hub, where you'll find all my posts and updates. Feel free to sign the guestbook! 

As I write this, I'm gutted by the news that ESPN might acquire UFC Fight Pass. As a fan, I love Fight Pass despite its clunky archiving and outdated features. It's still leagues better than anything ESPN could churn out with their subpar tech. This feels like a punch to the gut. Sad day, sad news.

A lot has happened since my last post about UFC 314, where I absolutely *nailed* my picks. Below, I’ve reviewed my Verdict picks since then, organized in a table with color-coded accuracy to show how I did (green for strong, red for rough). At the end, you’ll find my overall accuracy percentage.
