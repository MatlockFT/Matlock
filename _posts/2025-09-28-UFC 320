**Official Pick**: Jiří Procházka via TKO in Round 3

### Prediction
Ankalaev’s wrestling and counter-striking repeat his UFC 313 win, neutralizing Pereira’s power with clinch control and top time. Pereira’s hook and reach threaten early, but Ankalaev’s 85% TD defense and cardio secure a unanimous decision, defending his title.

**Official Pick**: Magomed Ankalaev via unanimous decision
