I had a very long evening on Friday night and wasn't able to complete my picks although I tried. I opted for sleep instead. My pick would've been Sterling... I think that comes at no surprise to anyone given the circumstances of Ortega's weight miss but I would've picked him regardless.

Saturday evening an entirely different event came to light which was Rampage Jackson's son, Raja, beating the breaks off a defenseless pro-wrestler. To keep it short and sweet, Raja and this pro-wrestler, Syko Stu, had a misunderstanding earlier in the evening. Stu used a prop can and smashed it on Raja's head thinking he was a pro-wrestler which he is not. Later that evening, Raja got into the wrestling ring and dumped Stu on his head knocking him out. Then followed up with around 20 punches, like heavy punches. Clearly Raja was not in control of himself and seeing red. There are more details to this story but ultimately Raja is clearly in the wrong and I wouldn't be surprised if he was charged with premeditated murder or something of the like. Stu was beaten within an inch of his life, choking on his own blood and teeth probably. Some people's opinions on it are jarring. Like one guy said "Its not your beef, its between them and maybe y'all should stfu"...
It was live streamed. It was in an arena with spectators. This was not a private affair. Even if it was a private beef, Raja made it public and now its open to criticism from everyone.
