**INTANGIBLES**
| **Attribute** | **Rodrigo Sezinando** | **Daniil Donchenko** |
|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Athleticism/General Physical Strength** | High; durable BJJ base at 27 | High; explosive striker at 24 |

| **Recuperative Powers** | Resilient; 8-1 post-loss | Strong; 11-2 with TUF streak |
| **Intelligence** | High; tactical BJJ | High; aggressive but tactical |

**Official Pick**: Rodrigo Sezinando via submission in Round 2  
**Reasoning**: Sezinando’s BJJ black belt and ground dominance exploit Donchenko’s two submission losses and poor takedown defense, securing a choke (likely RNC or armbar) in ground exchanges after surviving early striking. Donchenko’s 64% KO rate and youth (24) threaten in stand-up with high-volume punches and kicks, but Sezinando’s clinch control and grappling (27, experienced) neutralize it.

| **Summary** | Grinding decision fighter (100% decision rate); strong wrestling (3/6 TDs vs. Vidal) but struggles vs. strikers. Must control Pereira to win. | Explosive finisher (83% finish rate); aggressive striker, untested grappling. Must avoid Rendon’s wrestling to land KO. |

| **Recuperative Powers** | Resilient; 6-1 post-losses | Strong; 6-0, rapid rise |
| **Intelligence** | High; sticks to wrestling | High; technical for experience |

**Official Pick**: Alice Pereira via KO in Round 1  
**Reasoning**: Pereira’s youth (19), speed, and 83% finish rate (4 KOs, 1 sub) overwhelm Rendon’s wrestling-based approach. Rendon’s 18-month layoff and age (36) limit her against Pereira’s aggressive striking (4/6 KOs), likely landing a heavy cross or overhand early. Rendon’s wrestling (3/6 TDs vs. Vidal) may briefly stall Pereira, but her lack of finishing power (0 KOs/subs) and weakness against strikers (outstruck by Zheleznyakova) favor Pereira’s KO potential. Pereira wins her historic UFC debut.

| **Recuperative Powers** | Resilient; 2-1 post-losses | Resilient; 10-3 with NC |
| **Intelligence** | High; adapts mid-fight | High; tactical |

**Official Pick**: Alessandro Costa via TKO in Round 2  
**Reasoning**: Costa’s finishing ability (43% KO, 29% sub) and UFC experience (2-2) overpower Coria’s regional-level durability. Costa’s crisp striking (TKO vs. Borjas) and grappling (2/4 TDs vs. Flick) exploit Coria’s average defense, landing a heavy overhand or GnP finish. Coria’s cardio and scrambling keep him competitive early, but his untested UFC-level skills (0-0) falter against Costa’s pace.

| **Stage of Career** | Prospect; #168 middleweight; 2-1 UFC, wins over Marquez (TKO), Medina (decision). | Struggling veteran; #47 middleweight; 3-3 UFC, wins over Brundage, Azaitar, Fremd. |
| **Summary** | High-finishing (78% finish rate); long reach, KO power. Strong early, weak vs. wrestling. | Versatile but inconsistent (50% UFC win rate); aggressive striker, vulnerable to KOs. |

| **Recuperative Powers** | Strong; 2-0 post-loss | Resilient; 3-2 post-losses |
| **Intelligence** | High; tactical striker | Moderate; aggressive, reckless |

**Official Pick**: Zachary Reese via TKO in Round 1  
**Reasoning**: Reese’s 78% finish rate and 6'4" frame with 77" reach exploit Dumas’ weak chin (2 KO losses). Reese’s power (TKO vs. Marquez) lands early, likely via overhand or uppercut, overwhelming Dumas’ aggressive striking. Dumas’ 50% UFC win rate and recent KO loss (vs. Oleksiejczuk) show vulnerability, despite his reach (79") and clinch work. Reese’s home crowd (San Antonio) boosts momentum.

**Official Pick**: Jesus Aguilar via submission in Round 2  
**Reasoning**: Aguilar’s finishing ability (36% KO, 36% sub) and UFC experience (3-2) outmatch Gurule’s aggressive but untested style (0-1 UFC). Aguilar’s guillotine threat (3/4 subs) exploits Gurule’s average grappling, especially after Gurule’s TKO loss from bottom (vs. Osbourne). Gurule’s cardio and volume striking keep him competitive early, but Aguilar’s sharper boxing and BJJ secure a submission, likely guillotine.

**TATIANA SUAREZ VS AMANDA LEMOS**

| **Fighter** | **Tatiana Suarez ("The Barbarian")** | **Amanda Lemos ("Amandinha")** |

| **Record** | 10-1-0 | 15-4-1 |
| **Association** | Rancho Cucamonga, CA / Millennia MMA | Brazil / Cerrado MMA |
| **Stage of Career** | Prime contender; 34 years old with 9 years pro experience, #2 ranked women's strawweight; Former TUF 23 winner and undefeated (10-0) until unanimous decision loss to champion Zhang Weili at UFC 312 (Feb 2025); 7-1 UFC record with wins over Jéssica Andrade (sub, Aug 2023), Montana De La Rosa (sub, Feb 2023), Carla Esparza (TKO, Sep 2018), Alexa Grasso (sub, May 2018); Facing Amanda Lemos at UFC Fight Night 259 (Noche UFC) on Sep 13, 2025, in San Antonio, TX, as a potential No. 1 contender bout after injury-plagued career. | Veteran contender; 37 years old with 11 years pro experience, #6 ranked women's strawweight; 9-4-1 UFC record with recent unanimous decision win over Iasmin Lucindo (Mar 2025), unanimous decision loss to champion Zhang Weili (Aug 2023); wins over Mackenzie Dern (decision, Jul 2024), Virna Jandiroba (sub, Jul 2024), Marina Rodriguez (KO, Feb 2023); facing Tatiana Suarez at UFC Fight Night 259 (Noche UFC) on Sep 13, 2025, in San Antonio, TX, as a potential No. 1 contender bout. |
| **Summary** | Elite wrestler with suffocating grappling (3.5 TD avg, 60% accuracy) and submission threat (5 subs, 50% finish rate), Suarez dominates with chain wrestling and top control but has striking limitations (3.2 SLpM, 48% accuracy) and injury history limiting activity (only 2 fights since 2019). Her TUF pedigree and wins over champions highlight potential, but recent title loss exposed cardio and striking defense (absorbs 2.8 per min, 52% defense) against volume strikers like Lemos; excels in prolonged ground games but must avoid stand-up wars; rebound win could position her for rematch. | Explosive striker with knockout power (53% KO rate, 8 KOs) and submission threat (20% sub rate), Lemos excels in aggressive volume (4.5 SLpM, 50% accuracy) and clinch knees but has vulnerabilities in grappling (50% TD def) and cardio against elite wrestlers (controlled by Zhang). Her recent wins show resilience post-title loss, but losses to Zhang and Jandiroba highlight ground weaknesses (absorbs 3.5 per min, 48% defense); thrives in stand-up exchanges but must avoid Suarez's wrestling; win could earn title rematch. |

**Official Pick**: Tatiana Suarez via decision  
**Reasoning**: Suarez’s elite wrestling (3.5 TD avg, 60% accuracy) and grappling dominance (5 subs) exploit Lemos’ 50% takedown defense, leading to control time and outpointing her over three rounds. Lemos’ knockout power (53% KO rate, 4.5 SLpM) threatens early in stand-up, but Suarez’s 75% TD defense and top control neutralize it, as seen against Andrade. Suarez’s durability (52% striking defense) holds up against Lemos’ volume.

**Official Pick**: Claudio Puelles via submission in Round 2  
**Reasoning**: Puelles’ elite grappling (5 subs, 3 kneebars) and chain wrestling (7 TDs vs. Ziam) exploit Silva’s weak takedown defense (40%) and poor bottom game (controlled by Tsarukyan). Silva’s KO power (62% KO rate) threatens early, but Puelles’ durable chin (survived Hooker) and 72" reach keep him safe to shoot. Puelles secures a takedown and locks in a kneebar or RNC.

**Official Pick**: Duško Todorović via TKO in Round 1  
**Reasoning**: Todorović’s power striking (58% KO rate, 7 KOs) and aggressive output (4.5 SLpM) exploit Medina’s weak chin (KO’d by Gautier) and poor striking defense. Medina’s grappling edge (4 subs) is neutralized by Todorović’s functional takedown defense and superior GnP (3 TKOs). Todorović lands a heavy overhand or elbow early.

**Official Pick**: Santiago Luna via submission in Round 2  
**Reasoning**: Luna’s 100% finish rate (2 KOs, 4 subs) and youth (21) give him an edge over Le’s inconsistent UFC run (2-2). Luna’s grappling (4 subs) exploits Le’s weak takedown defense (50%, controlled by Gibson), likely securing a guillotine or armbar. Le’s striking power (44% KO rate) threatens early, but Luna’s untested chin and short-notice aggression (6-0, all finishes) overwhelm Le’s predictable style.

**Official Pick**: Diego Ferreira via submission in Round 3  
**Reasoning**: Ferreira’s elite BJJ (7 subs, 3rd-degree black belt) and technical grappling exploit Hernandez’s average takedown defense (60%) and vulnerability to submissions (submitted by Moicano). Hernandez’s striking power (47% KO rate) and recent momentum (three-fight win streak) threaten early, but Ferreira’s durability (never submitted, 6-2 post-losses) and clinch work (vs. Pettis) drag the fight to the mat. Ferreira secures an RNC or guillotine in a grinding battle.

**Reasoning**: Gastelum’s aggressive southpaw striking (5.2 SLpM, 32% KO rate) and durability (1 TKO loss) exploit Stoltzfus’ weak chin (2 KO losses) and average striking defense. Stoltzfus’ wrestling (2.2 TD avg) threatens, but Gastelum’s 65% takedown defense and scrambling ability (vs. Hendricks) keep the fight standing. Gastelum’s experience against elite competition (Adesanya, Souza) and power (6 KOs) overwhelm Stoltzfus’ gritty but limited game, landing a TKO to avoid a potential roster cut.

| **Attribute** | **Rafa Garcia** | **Jared Gordon** |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Athleticism/Strength** | Moderate; durable at 31 | Moderate; durable at 36 |
| **Cardio** | Strong; excels in decisions | Strong; maintains pace |
| **Chin** | Average; 1 TKO loss | Average; 1 TKO loss, NC via headbutt |
| **Recuperative Powers** | Resilient; 4-1 post-losses | Resilient; 5-3 post-losses |
| **Intelligence** | High; tactical BJJ/pressure | Moderate; gritty, predictable |

**Official Pick**: Jared Gordon via decision  
**Reasoning**: Gordon’s superior striking volume (5.67 SLpM, 55% accuracy) and recent KO power (vs. Moises, Madsen) overwhelm Garcia’s defensive striking (4.01 SLpM, 43% accuracy). Garcia’s grappling (5 subs) threatens, but Gordon’s 60% takedown defense and scrambling ability (vs. Solecki) keep the fight standing. Gordon’s durability and cardio (13 decision wins) outlast Garcia’s pressure, securing a decision win leveraging his 70-71% implied win probability.

**Official Pick**: Rob Font via decision  
**Reasoning**: Font’s technical striking (5.67 SLpM, 46% accuracy) and experience against elite competition (Aldo, Garbrandt) overwhelm Martinez’s raw power (50% KO rate) and limited UFC exposure (1 fight). Martinez’s aggressive striking (vs. Oliveira) threatens early, but Font’s durability (never KO’d) and cardio (9 decision wins) neutralize the upset potential. Font’s 60% takedown defense counters Martinez’s untested grappling, allowing Font to control range and outpoint the prospect over three rounds at UFC Fight Night 259 on extending his win streak to three.
