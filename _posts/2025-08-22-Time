I'm back with a new site design and outlook on what I want this website to be. I had to take a couple months, mostly because I moved but also to rethink what I want thi website to be. I suppose its my small way of defying major platforms. I also just miss the days of early internet where you could pretty much type anything into the address bar and someone had a website about something. So here will live a directory to my content and be the main host of my blog. I'll continue to build it as time goes on but I'm loving the old geo-cities look. 

Now, onto the fighting... (I'm actively writing this so if it ends abruptly, come back later)
