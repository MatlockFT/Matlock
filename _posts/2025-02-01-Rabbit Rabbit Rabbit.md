I’m hoping February brings better vibes—because, honestly, we could use them. Between Conor McGregor tweeting racial slurs and Bryce Mitchell praising a certain mustached German dictator, it’d be nice to focus on something other than politics and culture wars for a change.

Of course, that didn’t stop the neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and a bunch of confused individuals from crawling out of the woodwork. After I clipped the video, uploaded it, and attached it to one of Ariel Helwani’s posts, I suddenly found myself surrounded by Nazis—replying to the video, even following me. So, I had to spend way too much time arguing with them and telling them to fuck off.

A lot of these lost souls kept referencing a documentary called Europa, which, after looking into it, turned out to be nothing more than anti-Semitic propaganda that’s been thoroughly debunked. On the bright side, that clip did well on YouTube, and I made some money off their stupidity while arguing—so that was fun. But the real highlight? The Flat Earthers were upset with Bryce because they thought his rant would make flat-earth theories seem like “just another conspiracy.” What a time to be alive.

Anyway, back to Benavidez vs. Morrell...
