# Rabbit rabbit rabbit

I'm hoping February brings better vibes, for the lack of a better term. Between Conor McGregor tweeting racial slurs and Bryce Mitchell praising a certain mustached German dictator, we could use some stories that don't involve politics and culture wars.

Out of the woodwork came all the neo-nazis and white nationalists and confused individuals. I clipped the video and uploaded it, attached it to one of Ariel Helwani's posts and suddenly found myself amongst nazis. Replying to the video and even following me. So I had to spend a lot of time arguing back and telling them to fuck off. 

A lot of these confused souls kept referencing a documentary called Europa and when I looked into it, its just anti-semetic propaganda that's been thoroughly debunked. Luckily for me, that clip did pretty well on YouTube and I was able to monetarily profit off their stupidity while arguing so that was fun. What I really found amusing was that the Flat Earthers were disappointed in Bryce because of his pro-Hitler speech, citing that now people are going to think flat earth is "just a conspiracy". What a time to be alive.
