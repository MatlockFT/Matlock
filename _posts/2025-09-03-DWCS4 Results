## Recap

Wow, what a night! Dana White's Contender Series Week 4 was a solid event. While it may not have been the most thrilling overall, in my opinion, McMillen vs. Mgoyan delivered as I anticipated—if not more so.

In the opening round, Mgoyan attempted a takedown but found himself fighting out of a front headlock position. Once back on the feet, Mgoyan showcased a clear timing and speed advantage, dropping McMillen when he attempted a leg kick too close. From there, Mgoyan consistently pieced McMillen up with combinations, just as I predicted in my breakdown: 

> "I think Mgoyan will surprise McMillen on the feet. He strings together better combinations and mixes his strikes more effectively than McMillen, who relies heavily on kicks, particularly level-change feints and head kicks. McMillen also likes to close distance with knees. If Mgoyan has studied tape, these habits present excellent countering opportunities. I also believe Mgoyan can counter off McMillen’s jab and land combinations."

Credit to McMillen, though—he stayed composed. He tried to use his wrestling but struggled after getting rocked. Mgoyan, a strong wrestler and grappler himself, nearly finished McMillen with a tight guillotine that almost broke his neck as he turned belly down. Despite being on the ropes, McMillen kept throwing one-twos as the round ended. I scored it a 10-8 for Mgoyan. Rounds two and three went to McMillen, who ultimately won by decision, aligning perfectly with the bets I placed:
- Fight goes the distance: +120
- Tommy McMillen moneyline: +160
- Fight over 1.5 rounds: -199

On [Verdict](https://verdictmma.com/profile/matlockfighttalk), I picked Mgoyan, so I got that wrong, but my bets cashed. My Verdict picks went 3/5:
- David Mgoyan by decision: **Wrong**
- Eduardo Henrique ("Chapolin"): **Correct**
- Samuel Silva: **Wrong**
- Cezary Oleksiejczuk: **Correct**
- JP Lebosnoyani: **Correct**

An excellent Tuesday evening of fisticuffs—I give it an A- but Dana White didn't sign Chapolin which is insane. He looked to be the best fighter tonight.
Now, we look forward to UFC Fight Night: Imavov vs. Borralho.
