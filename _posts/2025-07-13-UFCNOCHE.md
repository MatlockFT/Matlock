### Summary
- **Rodrigo Sezinando**: Well-rounded with 50% KO rate and 25% sub rate, blending striking and BJJ. Showed durability in TUF, excelling in ground transitions but risks stand-up wars against Donchenko’s power. His BJJ black belt and championship pedigree make him a versatile threat, but he must avoid prolonged striking exchanges.
- **Daniil Donchenko**: Power striker with 64% KO rate, high-volume output, but subbed twice, exposing grappling weaknesses. His TUF KO flair highlights finishing ability, but he fades in longer fights. Excels in striking but is vulnerable to Sezinando’s BJJ, especially on the ground.

### Official Pick
**Rodrigo Sezinando via submission in Round 2**

**Reasoning**: Sezinando’s BJJ black belt and ground dominance exploit Donchenko’s two submission losses and poor takedown defense, securing a choke (likely RNC or armbar) in ground exchanges after surviving early striking. Donchenko’s 64% KO rate and youth (24) threaten in stand-up with high-volume punches and kicks, but Sezinando’s clinch control and grappling (27, experienced) neutralize it.

### Summary
- **Montserrat Rendon**: Grinding decision fighter with 100% decision rate, relying on strong wrestling (3/6 TDs vs. Vidal) but struggling against strikers. Her 18-month layoff and age (36) may hinder her against Pereira’s youth and power. Must control the fight on the ground to win.
- **Alice Pereira**: Explosive finisher with 83% finish rate (4 KOs, 1 sub), showcasing aggressive striking but untested grappling. At 19, her youth and power make her a dangerous debutant, but she must avoid Rendon’s wrestling to land a knockout.

| **Intelligence**       | High; sticks to wrestling                  | High; technical for experience          |

### Official Pick
**Alice Pereira via KO in Round 1**

**Reasoning**: Pereira’s youth (19), speed, and 83% finish rate (4 KOs, 1 sub) overwhelm Rendon’s wrestling-based approach. Rendon’s 18-month layoff and age (36) limit her against Pereira’s aggressive striking (4/6 KOs), likely landing a heavy cross or overhand early. Rendon’s wrestling (3/6 TDs vs. Vidal) may briefly stall Pereira, but her lack of finishing power (0 KOs/subs) and weakness against strikers (outstruck by Zheleznyakova) favor Pereira’s KO potential in her historic UFC debut.

### Summary
- **Alessandro Costa**: Versatile finisher with 43% KO rate and 29% sub rate, blending crisp striking and BJJ. Excels in early rounds but fades late. His UFC experience (2-2) and finishing ability make him a favorite against Coria’s untested UFC-level skills.
- **Alden Coria**: Balanced fighter with 40% KO rate and 20% sub rate, durable but untested at UFC level. His regional success (5-1 in last 6) shows promise, but he must survive Costa’s early aggression and grappling to compete.

### Official Pick
**Alessandro Costa via TKO in Round 2**

**Reasoning**: Costa’s finishing ability (43% KO, 29% sub) and UFC experience (2-2) overpower Coria’s regional-level durability. Costa’s crisp striking (TKO vs. Borjas) and grappling (2/4 TDs vs. Flick) exploit Coria’s average defense, landing a heavy overhand or ground-and-pound finish. Coria’s cardio and scrambling keep him competitive early, but his untested UFC-level skills (0-0) falter against Costa’s pace.

### Summary
- **Zachary Reese**: High-finishing prospect with 78% finish rate, leveraging long reach and KO power. Strong early but weak against wrestling, making him vulnerable to ground control. His height (6'4") and home crowd in San Antonio boost his chances.
- **Sedriques Dumas**: Versatile but inconsistent (50% UFC win rate), with aggressive striking but a weak chin (2 KO losses). His clinch work and grappling give him a chance, but recent KO loss exposes vulnerabilities against power strikers like Reese.

### Official Pick
**Zachary Reese via TKO in Round 1**

**Reasoning**: Reese’s 78% finish rate and 6'4" frame with 77" reach exploit Dumas’ weak chin (2 KO losses). Reese’s power (TKO vs. Marquez) lands early, likely via overhand or uppercut, overwhelming Dumas’ aggressive striking. Dumas’ 50% UFC win rate and recent KO loss (vs. Oleksiejczuk) show vulnerability, despite his reach (79") and clinch work. Reese’s home crowd (San Antonio) boosts momentum.

### Summary
- **Jesus Aguilar**: Versatile finisher with 36% KO rate and 36% sub rate, blending crisp boxing and BJJ. Weak takedown defense (42%) exposes him to grapplers, but his submission threat and UFC experience make him a favorite against Gurule’s untested elite skills.
- **Luis Gurule**: Aggressive striker with 30% KO rate and 20% sub rate, durable with strong cardio. His 0-1 UFC record and TKO loss from bottom highlight grappling vulnerabilities against Aguilar’s BJJ.

### Official Pick
**Jesus Aguilar via submission in Round 2**

**Reasoning**: Aguilar’s finishing ability (36% KO, 36% sub) and UFC experience (3-2) outmatch Gurule’s aggressive but untested style (0-1 UFC). Aguilar’s guillotine threat (3/4 subs) exploits Gurule’s average grappling, especially after Gurule’s TKO loss from bottom (vs. Osbourne). Gurule’s cardio and volume striking keep him competitive early, but Aguilar’s sharper boxing and BJJ secure a submission, likely guillotine.

### Summary
- **Tatiana Suarez**: Elite wrestler with suffocating grappling (3.5 TD avg, 60% accuracy) and submission threat (50% finish rate). Dominates with chain wrestling and top control but has striking limitations (3.2 SLpM, 48% accuracy) and injury history. Her recent title loss exposed cardio and striking defense against volume strikers like Lemos. Must dominate on the ground to win.
- **Amanda Lemos**: Explosive striker with 53% KO rate and 20% sub rate, excelling in aggressive volume (4.5 SLpM) and clinch knees. Vulnerable to elite wrestlers (50% TD defense), with losses to Zhang and Jandiroba highlighting ground weaknesses. Thrives in stand-up but must avoid Suarez’s wrestling.
