As Trump manipulates the markets and the ABC is working with promoters to potentially modify the Ali Act in a way that could harm the fighters, MMA continues to roll on. I like this card! I can't tell if it’s because I've been starved and only fed bread and this is like getting some soup, or if this is actually a decent meal. I feel like it’s a decent meal.

### Volk vs. Lopes
Technically speaking, there are many flaws in Lopes' game and, despite pushback from pundits, I feel Lopes has cardio issues. There are plenty of fights to point to, but he takes rounds off to recompose himself because he goes so damn hard. Youth, power, recklessness, and hype are all on Lopes' side, while Volk has the age statistic and has been KO’d. I always go against my best judgment because history shows that Lopes should win this fight, but I cannot commit to that. I feel like it’s a bit much, a bit too soon. My assumption is that Volk will find a way to survive the initial rounds in a violent affair in the first 12 minutes until Volk finds a path to victory. Method? Great question... I'm not trying to overthink it, so Volk by decision. Can't wait to see Lopes win by knockout in the first minute...

### Chandler vs. Pimblett
I can't remember if I've picked Paddy to win yet. I definitely picked Bobby Green to win, and that was abysmal. I feel similar about Paddy as I do about DDP—not a direct comparison, but somewhat similar. I'm not completely sold on the skill and the wonkiness of their styles to win. Chandler is definitely an entertaining fighter with some solid skills, no question, but he defeats himself in most of the fights he's in. This may be the first time I lean on the side of Pimblett... Will this be one of those situations where I finally side with the guy I pick against, and he loses? Haha... maybe. I will be honest and say when I first heard about this matchup, my friend Keenan asked me who I was picking, and I said I'm leaning Chandler. He said he's picking Pimblett. To be fair, I said I hadn't really looked into it and reserved the right to change my pick. Here is my reserved right. Leaning Pimblett, although I hate that his chin is so high and he gasses out, but he's huge. Hopefully Chandler contacted Merab for some of that EPO he's been using. Pimblett to win... How the fuck will he do it, though? Do I really think Chandler is going to get submitted by Pimblett? He's only been subbed once! I suppose at this age, it’s possible. Fine... in real-time, you've just read that I'm picking Pimblett by submission. But I am fairly confident this fight has all the elements to be a Loony Tunes, wacky-ass fight. Best of luck to both.
