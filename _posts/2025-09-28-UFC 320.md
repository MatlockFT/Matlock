I love October.

For the main event, I'm kinda sticking with the same analysis I had as last time. I'm rolling with Poatan by KO but probably most likely is Magomed getting another decision. 
Merab and Corey is a curious case. Everytime I watch tape on Merab, I end up picking against him. He's sloppy and gets hit a lot. He's won fights he's actually lost and I think it really just comes down to optics in a lot of his victories. I don't have a ton of confidence in Corey to get a victory but he can. Either by sub or KO. Merab has lost by both during the fights and came back to win. 
I'm going with Khalil to get a victory as well... although his mental always worries me...
