| **Height**             | 5'4" (1.63 m)                              | 5'3" (1.59 m)                           |

| **Record**             | 6-0-0                                      | 8-1-0                                   |
| **Association**        | Great Britain Top Team (London, England) / Team Underground MMA | Unknown (Brazilian regional gyms, Jungle Fight affiliates) |
| **Stage of Career**    | Rising undefeated prospect; 24 years old with 3 years pro experience, parted ways with PFL after 3-0 run (including head-kick KO vs. Torchinava and split decision vs. Scatizzi in 2024 playoffs); Former amateur standout (8-3 record, multiple titles in ECMMA, CWSE, Four Nations); UFC debut opportunity via DWCS Week 5 on September 9, 2025, vs. Carol Foro; hyped UK talent with Muay Thai background (27 world/European/British titles), seeking contract to launch UFC career. | Rising finisher; 29 years old with 5 years pro experience, Jungle Fight Strawweight Champion (defended 1x); 8-1 record with 7-fight win streak (all KOs/TKOs since Jan 2024 loss); DWCS debut vs. Shanelle Dyer on September 9, 2025, seeking UFC contract after regional dominance in Brazil. |

### Summary
- **Shanelle Dyer**: A flashy striker with knockout power from Muay Thai roots (67% KO rate, 4 TKOs in 6 wins), Dyer overwhelms with explosive head kicks and spinning elbows but has unproven grappling depth in pro (no subs, limited ground time). Her PFL run showcased fan-friendly violence and composure in decisions, but regional opposition raises questions on elite competition; excels in stand-up chaos against aggressive foes but vulnerable to wrestlers due to average TD defense (estimated 60% from amateurs). At 24, her youth and striking creativity make her a high-upside prospect for UFC flyweight, but she must demonstrate well-roundedness vs. Foro's power; win here secures contract and fast-track to rankings.
- **Carol Foro**: A power puncher with brutal finishing instinct (88% KO rate, 7 TKOs in 8 wins), Foro crushes with body shots and ground-and-pound but has limited exposure against elite strikers (sole loss by decision). Her streak includes quick KOs vs. low-level opposition (e.g., Esquer TKO Rd. 1), showcasing aggression and power; however, average cardio (most fights under 5 min) and untested grappling (1 sub win early) raise questions. At 29, her compact build suits grinding, but she must handle Dyer's range and kicks; win earns contract, positioning her as Brazilian flyweight prospect.

### Intangibles

| Aspect                 | Shanelle Dyer                              | Carol Foro                              |

### Official Pick
**Shanelle Dyer via TKO in Round 2.**

**Reasoning**: Dyer's superior Muay Thai striking and reach advantage should allow her to outrange Foro early, landing devastating head kicks and knees to exploit Foro's average defense against volume. Foro's power and aggression pose a pocket threat, but her regional can-crushing streak meets a step-up in Dyer's creativity and cardio, leading to a mid-fight finish on DWCS September 9, 2025, earning Dyer the UFC contract.

| **Stage of Career**    | Rising prospect in early prime; 26 years old with 5 years pro experience, recent sub win over Florin Pîrtea at Cage Warriors 177 (Sep 2024); 7-3 record with 3 wins by sub, 2 by KO; DWCS Week 5 bout vs. Samuel Sanches on Sep 9, 2025, for UFC contract after previous DWCS loss to Kody Steele (Oct 2024); former UNC wrestler (redshirt sophomore at 184 lbs), transitioning from amateur wrestling to pro MMA with Cage Warriors experience. | Rising undefeated streak prospect; 22 years old with 4 years pro experience, 10-1 record with 7-fight win streak (mix of KOs/subs); Recent TF win (Mar 2025); DWCS Week 5 vs. Chasen Blair on Sep 9, 2025, for UFC contract; Brazilian regional standout (Jungle Fight affiliates), coached by Yuri Moura/Herrick Marinho, seeking global breakout. |

### Summary
- **Chasen Blair**: A wrestling-based grappler with solid submissions (43% sub rate) and improving striking, Blair uses chain wrestling and ground control for wins but has vulnerabilities in striking defense against power punchers (2 KO losses). His recent sub streak highlights BJJ growth (brown belt), but low volume striking (estimated 3.5 SLpM) and cardio in decisions (43% decisions) need refinement; excels against regional grapplers but untested vs. elite strikers like Sanches. At 26, his youth and athleticism make him a UFC-ready prospect if he shores up stand-up; favored in DWCS due to experience, win could launch top-15 trajectory.
- **Samuel Sanches**: A versatile finisher with power striking and BJJ (black belt under Moura), Sanches boasts 70% finish rate (4 KOs, 3 subs) but sole loss by decision exposes cardio in longer fights. His streak includes quick KOs vs. regional foes, showcasing aggression and transitions; however, untested vs. wrestlers like Blair (estimated 60% TD def.). At 22, his height/reach and youth make him a dynamic prospect, but he must handle grappling pressure; favored for explosiveness, win earns UFC spot in stacked lightweight.

### Summary
- **Felipe Franco**: A powerful finisher with knockout-heavy style (63% KO rate) and opportunistic subs from BJJ base, Franco dominates regionals with aggressive pressure and ground-and-pound but has untested cardio in decisions (all wins by finish). His streak includes quick TKOs vs. low-level opposition, showcasing raw power and wrestling; however, limited exposure to elite strikers and average TD defense (estimated 60%) raise questions. At 30, his size and finishing threat make him a DWCS favorite vs. Vidal's experience, but he must handle stand-up wars; win earns UFC spot, positioning him as Brazilian LHW prospect.
- **Freddy Vidal**: An aggressive striker with knockout power (67% KO rate) and solid wrestling, Vidal pressures with heavy hands and clinch work but has untested sub defense and cardio in longer fights (1 decision). His short pro career shows promise in regional promotions like LFA/Flex Fights, but limited experience vs. finishers like Franco (estimated 65% TD def.). At 30, his size and durability make him a DWCS contender, but he must avoid ground; win positions him for UFC lightweight/LHW, loss stalls momentum.

### Summary
- **Cam Teague**: A wrestling-based fighter with finishing power (44% KO rate, 44% sub rate), Teague uses explosive takedowns and ground control for wins but showed striking vulnerabilities in DWCS loss (absorbed heavy volume before TKO). His regional run highlights athleticism and scrambling, but low striking accuracy (estimated 45%) and defense (55%) need improvement against veterans like Douglas; excels in chaotic scrambles but untested in decisions (11% decisions). At 27, his youth and wrestling make him a high-upside prospect for UFC featherweight, but he must evolve stand-up to secure contract; rebound win could fast-track rankings.
- **Lerryan Douglas**: A well-rounded finisher with knockout power (50% KO rate) and grappling (25% sub rate), Douglas pressures with heavy hands and transitions but has vulnerabilities in takedown defense (55% estimated) against wrestlers (2 sub losses). His LFA title run showcases endurance and adaptability (4-fight streak), but absorbs high volume (3.5 per min.); excels in pocket wars and clinch, but untested vs. young wrestlers like Teague. At 30, his experience and finishing threat make him DWCS favorite; win earns UFC spot, positioning for top-15 featherweight run.

### Summary
- **Anthony Guarascio**: A knockout artist (75% KO rate) with raw power and relentless pressure, Guarascio overwhelms with heavy right hands and body shots but has untested grappling (no pro ground time). His CFFC title win showcased devastating striking (all KOs under 72 seconds), but limited opposition and self-training raise durability questions; excels in stand-up brawls but vulnerable to wrestlers like Asplund (estimated 50% TD defense). At 29, his size and charisma make him a marketable heavyweight prospect, but he must survive grappling to secure UFC contract; favored for power but risky against technical foes.
- **Steven Asplund**: A towering finisher (80% KO rate) with massive size and striking power, Asplund uses reach and resilience to dominate but has grappling holes (loss via sub to Freeman). His LFA run showcases heavy hands and durability, but average cardio (fades in decisions) and 60% TD defense expose weaknesses vs. wrestlers; excels in stand-up wars but must avoid ground against untested grapplers like Guarascio. At 26, his youth and physicality make him a DWCS threat; slight underdog but could upset with range control.
